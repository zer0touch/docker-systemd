         try again to boot into default mode.

need CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability you can add --privileged true or as in the example above --caps-add SYS_ADMIN

Looking at what I had done to prevent this in virt-sandbox-service, I saw that I needed to remove unit file links from the /lib/systemd/system/*wants/ and  /etc/systemd/system/*wants/ directories within a systemd based docker container.  Removing these links got me to a systemd container image that would only run systemd and journald.

# example nginx img using systemd to start :D

         docker build -t dockerimages/docker-nginx-systemd - <<EOF
         FROM dockerimages/docker-systemd
         RUN apt-get install -y nginx; apt-get clean; systemctl enable nginx.service
         EXPOSE 80
         CMD [“/lib/systemd/systemd”]
         EOF


or simply directly :D

         docker run --cap-add SYS_ADMIN -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -p 80:80 dockerimages/docker-nginx-systemd


thats it have fun with systemd
